# HIGROTERM
This is the official repository of the open-source HIGROTERM system for laboratory monitoring of temperature and humidity.

Any scientific publications regarding HIGROTERM will be also made available here, whether in full text or reference links.

If you find HIGROTERM useful for your scientific work, or if you have used HIGROTERM in some way, consider citing the following references:

  1. HIGROTERM repoitory on GitHub, using its DOI: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5525381.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5525381)

The HIGROTERM system is an open-source temperature and humidity system developed at the Laboratory of Material Testing at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of the University of Bras√≠lia.

In order to use the source code in your hardware, please access the "Source Code" folder and access the "A000_SourceCode_HIGROTERM_EnPtVersion_v0_4_DUE_Version", in which all the source .ino files are available, as well as two C files containing icon and fonts definition. The files in the "Documentation" folder will help you to understand the source code structure and to install the necessary libraries to upload the sketch in your Arduino.

Soon it will be uploaded a schematic on the necessary hardware required to run the current version of HIGROTERM. 

The HIGROTERM source code itself is licensed under the MIT license. However, the source code makes use of external libraries developed by third parties that are licensed under a myriad of different licenses. Please, make sure you consult the Documentations folder, in which the PDF file "ABOUT THE LIBRARIES" contains links to each library, as well as their current licenses (11, June 2020), in order to check if the use you intend for the HIGROTERM system complies with all the licenses involved.

Finally, for further guidance regarding the source code and libraries, please refer to the Documentation folder, into which you will find a PDF file "ABOUT THE SOURCE CODE" with a brief explanation about the source code structure, and the libraries used by the HIGROTERM source code, as well as the links to download them and the license under which they are released, in the PDF file "ABOUT THE LIBRARIES".

Hope you enjoy the project.

Best regards,
